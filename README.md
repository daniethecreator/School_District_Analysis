# School_District_Analysis
Week 4 Module 4 PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to replace the altered datat for Thomas High School and re-run the original analysis looking at the different schools in PyCity. This including looking at overall passing for reading and math by a few different splits such as by grade, school size, school budget, and school type to see if there were any patterns that can help determine where students would be most successful and where there was need for improvemnt. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
